`topology` - the design or look of the network

Star

Every devices connect through a central networking device, such as a `switch` or `hub`

    - most commonly found
    - reliability and scalability

    - pricey, more cabling, purchase of dedicated networking equipments
    - the more the network scales, the more maintainance is required
    - harder to troubleshooting, prone to failure - albeit reduced


Bus

Devices rely on a single connection known as a `backbone cable`
Similar to a leaf off a tree such that devices (leaves) stem from the where the branches are on this cable

    - easier and more cost-efficient to setup

    - prone to becoming slow, bottleneck, since every devies go through the same cable
    - difficult troubleshooting since hard to determine which device is experiencing issues with all the data going to the same place
    - little redundancy in place in case of failure, cause of having a single point of failure along the backbone cable can hinderance the connected devices


Ring / Token

Devices are connected directly to each other to form a loop/ring
Data is sent across the loop until it reaches the dstined destination, using other devices along the loop to foward said data. * will only send/forward data from another device if the device itself doesn't have it already

    - little cabling requirement
    - less dependence on dedicated hardware compared to the Star
    - fairly easy to trouble shoot since data only goes in 1 direction
    - less prone to bottleneck compared to Bus

    - inefficient in data travelling, since things might have to go through multiple other devices before reaching its destination
    - a broken device will break the whole network

------
Switch

Device in a network that is designed to aggregate multiple other devices, like computers, printers or anything networking-capable using `ethernet` cables.
These various devices plug into a switch's `port`, ports number can be 4 8 16 24 32 or 64
Is usually found in larger networks such as businesses, schools etc.

Switch is much more efficient than their lesser couterpart (hub/repeater)
    it keeps track of what device is connected to which port, so when packets are needed to send to a specific one, instead of sending to every ports like how hub used to do, switch will send to that one device --> help reduces traffic aross the network

Switches and `routers` can be connected to one another, increasing the redundancy (reliability) of a network byt adding multiple paths for data to take. If one goes down, data can go through the other


Router

Jobs are connect networks and pass data between them by using `routing`

Routing is the process of of data travelling across networks.
This involves creating a path between networks so that said data can be delivered. Very useful when devices are connected by many paths.
