The act of splitting up a network into smaller, minature networks within itself. (for easier handling, troubleshooting)
    assigning a specific parts of the network to each Department

Subnetting is acheived by splitting up the number of `hosts` that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a `subnet mask`.


IP addresses

    made up of four section called `octets`
	192 .	168 .	1   .	1
	0-255	0-255	0-255	0-255
    same for subnet mask, represnted as a number of four bytes (32bits), ranging from 0-255

    Subnets use IP in 3 different ways:
	identify the network address
	identify the host address
	identify the default `gateway`
    
		Purpose				    Explaination

    Network	Identifies the start	    A device IP of 192.168.1.100
    address	of the actual network	    belongs to the network of
		And is used to identify		192.168.1.0
		a network's existence

    Host	Identfies a device	    A device can have IP
    address	on the subnet		    ranging from
						192.168.1.1-254

    Default	Special address		    Any data that go out of the
    gateway	assigned to device on	    subnet will be sent here.
		the network, capable of	    This can use any number from
		sending information to	    1 to 254, but usually is
		another network			    1 or 254


Subnetting benifits
    - efficiency
    - security
    - full control
