ARP - address resolution protocol
    the technology that allows devices to identify themselves on a network
	simply allowing a device to associate its MAC with an IP
	each device will keep a log of MAC addresses associated with other devices


When a device wish to communicate with anotehr, they send out a `broadcast` to the entire network searching for the specific device


How does ARP work?

    Each device has a ledger to store information called `cache`.
    In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of othe devices on the network.

    In order to map MAC with IP, the ARP sends 2 types of messages
	ARP Request	and	ARP Reply

	ARP Request sends out broadcast asking whether or not the devices' MAC matches the requested IP. 
	If one device does have the requested IP, it will send a ARP Reply back to the broadcasting/initial device.
	The initial device will now store that in its cache/ARP Entry


MAC address - physical identifier of a device
IP  address - logical  identifier of a device
