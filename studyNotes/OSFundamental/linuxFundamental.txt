su - swith user
sudo / root
su -l	to directly go to the new "user"'s home folder


Common directories

/etc - etcetera
    one of the most important root dir
    commonplace to store system files that are used by the OS
	sudoers		contains list of users or groups that have permission to run sudo or a set of cmds as the root user
	passwd	shadow	show how the OS stores the passwords of each user in encrypted formatting called `sha512`

/var - variable data
    one of the main root folders
    stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system
	log files from running services and applications are written in /var/log
	other data that is not necessarily associated with a specific user i.e. databases

/root
    unlike /home, /root is actually the home of the "root" system user. And that's it, there's nothing more to it than being the home of "root" user
    ** note: the logical presumption is that this user would have their date in a dir such as /home/root by default

/tmp - temporary
    is a unique root dir
    This dir is volatile and is used to store date that is only needed to be accessed once or twice, hence temporary
    Its content, similar to memmory's are cleared when the computer restarts
    ** Useful for pentesting: any user can write to this by default. Meaning once we have access, it serves as a good place to store things like our enumeration scripts.

Processes101

    Processes are programs that are running on your machine
    Managed by the `kernel`, each process with have an ID, this ID is also known as PID
	PID increments for the the order in which the process starts, i.e. the 60th process with have PID of 60

    ps		to list running processes as current user's session
    ps aux	to list processes ran by other users and those that don't run from session (system processes)

    top / htop	other tools for viewing processes

    kill PID	to stop a process
	some other commands that correlate to exactly how "cleanly" the process is dealt with by the kernel
	    SIGTERM	kill, but allows it to do some cleanup task beforehand
	    SIGKILL	kill, doesn't cleanup
	    SIGSTOP	stop/suspend a process

How do processes start?

Run at startup / Start on Boot
    systemctl
	start / stop
	enable / disable
